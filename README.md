This project aims to not use any library or module that provides "plug and play" UI components.

The reason for that is that I want to learn to make my own UI components without basing myself off of "proven" modules like Material UI, antd, Chakra UI, etc...

Things you would normally use from these libraries like buttons, option dropdowns, modals, tooltips, toast notifications, etc. are built from the ground up, even if they are not to the standard of other components in regards to accessibility, API design, or performance.
